Your gender may affect how some mobiles treat you in this demo game. The choices are fairly straightforward--male, female, and neuter. Neuter implies lack of a gender rather than loss of a gender (as in not a eunich). Gender does not affect character attributes in this demo MUD, though that could be configured.
