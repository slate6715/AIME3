Your race not only affects how some NPCs interact with you, but affect your starting attributes. There are three races in this demo MUD. 
Human - Average attributes.
Elf - Attributes that favor dexterity at the expense of strength.
Dwarf - Attributes that favor strength at the expense of dexterity.
