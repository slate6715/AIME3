<desc>A void extends in all directions to infinity. While most voids are often just dark, foreboding places, this one is without any form whatsoever...just...empty. Nothing. Well, nothing, except the dark surface that you stand upon. Beneath that hard surface is a sense of further depth, stretching into the unknown. The surface seems to flex slightly under your weight, hinting at its fragility. Jumping too hard upon it may cause cracking and infinite plunging into the nothing that lies in the deep places of the void. 

To the east, there's appears to be slightly less darkness.

<desc>The surface, while solid enough to hold your weight, flexes with each step. This is accompanied by hundreds of faint crinkling noises that almost sound like static.

Admodeus is the picture of the true southern gentleman. He sports a completely white suit and carries a black cane. His hair is white, as is his oversized mustache. Completing the image is a small goatee under his chin.

<roomdesc>Admodeus carries a long, black staff casually in his right hand.</roomdesc>
<desc>
The staff is made of a smooth, hard material that appears to absorb all light. It is a consistent width down it's length, terminated by a copper cap at the bottom. At the top, an impossibly-large large pearl has been fixed into the material, providing an easy handhold.

<desc>You stand on a narrow transparent walkway that runs east to west over a raging sea. Large swells come within inches of the platform, glistening in the sunlight. A fine layer of white salt coats the pathway, creating a certain grit under your feet. The pathway extends to the west where the water appears to calm. To the east, a faint shadow can be seen on the horizon.

<flag name="Bright" />
<desc>A beach stretches from north to south, creating a cooridor between a raging sea to the west and impassible chalk cliffs to the east. Large breakers crash a hundred meters off shore and wash onto fine white sand. The sand is devoid of any signs of life--no shells, dead fish or vegetation. A transparent walkway extends over the raging sea to the west and the beach extends both north and south.

<exit name="south" location="start:beach" />
<flag name="Outdoors" />
<desc>The beach ends at a chalk cliff. The rock walls of the cliff extend above you to the north and east while the beach continues to the south. The sea and cliff walls extend north but without safe passage. Attempting to swim it would result in a quick death as waves smash violently against jagged rocks at the cliff base. The beach is littered with chunks of chalk but, one again, no signs of life.

<desc>Plant life abounds to the east as an impassible jungle arises out of the sandy soil. The waves wash up on the smooth sand, leaving behind the occasional kelp mass. The beach continues south, bordered by the jungle on the east and the sea on the west. To the north, the jungle fizzles and disaapears. While there's ample sign of plant life, the jungle and beach are strangey devoid of any signs of animal life.
